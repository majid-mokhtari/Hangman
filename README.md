# Hangman
This Android game is based on the traditional paper and pencil guessing game where you can choose a category and based on that you have to guess a word or phrase by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses. Failed attempts are recorded by drawing a gallows and someone hanging on it, line by line.
